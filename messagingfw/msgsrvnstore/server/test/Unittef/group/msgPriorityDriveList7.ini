# - The first drive in the list which is either empty OR has a valid message store will be the current drive.
# - The device internal memory must present in the preferred drive list. If the drive is not mentioned in the list, it will be appended at the end of the preferred drive list. The last drive hence mentioned below will be removed from the list.
